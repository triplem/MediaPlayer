This page is for the badly named LCD Display plugin.

It is for the Rapsi only because it uses the GPIO.

It uses a standard HDD44780 compliant display.

In my case I used a OLED from Maplin [OLED 20x2](http://www.maplin.co.uk/alphanumeric-oled-character-displays-787316)

Here is the connection diagram for the LCD (I've just discovered [Fritzing](http://fritzing.org/))

Because I used an OLED display I don't need any connections for the display contrast or +V or Ov for the LED power
